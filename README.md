# WareEye

WareEye is a real-time pallet tracking and validation system built for
warehouse environments. It combines video-based barcode scanning with
centralized logging and a simple dashboard for visibility and control.

## What It Does

WareEye consists of two Python components:

* **Server** â€“ a lightweight Flask app that stores barcode scans and provides a
  simple web interface to review scan records.
* **Client** â€“ a video stream scanner that detects barcodes (e.g. QR, Code128)
  via webcam or RTSP and sends scan results to the server.

## Core Features

### ðŸ“¦ Pallet Tracking
Detects and tracks barcoded pallets as they move throughout the warehouse using
live camera feeds.

### ðŸšš Load Validation
Automatically validates that the correct pallets are being loaded into outbound
trucksâ€”without requiring the driver to leave the vehicle. This is especially
useful when handling expensive or sensitive shipments.

## Running the Server

```bash
cd Server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

By default the server runs on port `5000` and stores scans in `app.db`
(SQLite).

## Running the Client

```bash
cd Client
pip install -r requirements.txt
python client.py
```

The client opens a webcam or RTSP stream and continuously scans video frames
for barcodes. Each detected code is sent to the server with a timestamp.

## How You Can Help

WareEye is a work in progress, and we're looking for collaborators! You can
help us improve:

* ðŸ“ˆ Detection accuracy and frame processing speed
* ðŸŽ¨ The UI and scan dashboard
* ðŸ“¦ Packaging for Docker, Windows, and embedded devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi)
