# WareEye

WareEye is a real-time pallet tracking and validation system built for
warehouse environments. It combines video-based barcode scanning with
centralized logging and a simple dashboard for visibility and control.

## What It Does

WareEye is organized into three main folders:

* **Server** â€“ a lightweight Flask app that stores barcode scans and provides a
  simple web interface to review scan records.
* **security-camera-server** â€“ camera client for general surveillance and
  pallet tracking around the warehouse.
* **dock-door-server** â€“ camera client focused on dock door barcode
  validation.

## Core Features

### ðŸ“¦ Pallet Tracking
Detects and tracks barcoded pallets as they move throughout the warehouse using
live camera feeds.

### ðŸšš Load Validation
Automatically validates that the correct pallets are being loaded into outbound
trucksâ€”without requiring the driver to leave the vehicle. This is especially
useful when handling expensive or sensitive shipments.

## Running the Server

```bash
cd Server
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

By default the server runs on port `5000` and stores scans in `app.db`
(SQLite).

### Building Static Assets with npm

The web interface relies on Tailwind CSS. Inside the `Server` folder you can
install the Node dependencies and build the stylesheet:

```bash
cd Server
npm install
npm run build
```

Run `npm run build` again whenever you modify `tailwind.css`.

## Running the Camera Clients

The project ships with two camera modules:

* `security-camera-server/` â€“ for general warehouse surveillance and pallet tracking.
* `dock-door-server/` â€“ for barcode validation at dock doors.

```bash
# pick one of the camera folders
cd security-camera-server  # or dock-door-server
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python client.py
```

Each camera module opens a webcam or RTSP stream and continuously scans frames
for barcodes. Detected codes are sent to the server with a timestamp.

### Example Data (EX/)

Use the `EX/` folder to try WareEye without a live camera. It contains sample
images and CSVs so you can simulate barcode scans and test the pipeline end to
end.

## How You Can Help

WareEye is a work in progress, and we're looking for collaborators! You can
help us improve:

* ðŸ“ˆ Detection accuracy and frame processing speed
* ðŸŽ¨ The UI and scan dashboard
* ðŸ“¦ Packaging for Docker, Windows, and embedded devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi)
